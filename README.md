# ELEC70073-Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
This repository contains the code for the coursework:  
**Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition** (CVPR)  

Except for the original dataset, the work can be reused as open-access.

## Repository structure  
The **computer vision** part was initially branched from  **CVPR_Coursework_2021**:  
- [CVPR_Coursework_2021](https://github.com/Xinyang-S/CVPR_Coursework_2021)  

  
With respect to Xinyang and Yuancheng's work, our CV upgrades consist of:
- :white_check_mark: Provides a further explanation of the image dataset;  
- :white_check_mark: Quantive comparison of correspondences found by two methods(i.e. manually and automatically);
- :white_check_mark: Improved the depth map by using the SGM algorithm with a rescaled image.
